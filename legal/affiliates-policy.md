**About BetterPic:** BetterPic is a digital service operated and managed by IndieInnova, S.L. ("IndieInnova"). For the purposes of this Policy, references to "BetterPic" shall pertain to the digital service provided by IndieInnova, S.L. All matters related to BetterPic, including this Affiliates Policy, are governed by the laws of Spain.

As an authorized affiliate (Affiliate) of BetterPic, you agree to abide by the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement (Agreement). Please read the entire Agreement carefully before registering and promoting BetterPic as an Affiliate.

Your participation in the Program is solely to legally advertise our website to receive a commission on memberships and products purchased by individuals referred to BetterPic by your own website or personal referrals.

By signing up for the BetterPic Affiliate Program (Program), you indicate your acceptance of this Agreement and its terms and conditions.

## 1. Approval or Rejection of the Application
We reserve the right to approve or reject ANY Affiliate Program Application in our sole and absolute discretion. You will have no legal recourse against us for the rejection of your Affiliate Program Application.

## 2. Commissions
Commissions will be paid once a month. For an Affiliate to receive a commission, the referred account must complete at least one order fully and receive the results. Commissions are eligible for payout after 30 days of the order being completed. Commissions require a minimum balance of 30€ to be eligible for payout.

You cannot refer yourself, and you will not receive a commission on your own accounts. There is also a limit of one commission per referral. If someone clicks the link on your site and orders multiple accounts, then you will receive a commission on the first order only.

Payments will only be sent for transactions that have been successfully completed. Transactions that result in chargebacks or refunds will not be paid out.

Affiliates will receive a 20% commission on the first 2 payments made by a user during their first 12 months on the platform.

## 3. Termination
Your affiliate application and status in the Program may be suspended or terminated for any of the following reasons:

- Inappropriate advertisements (false claims, misleading hyperlinks, etc.).
- Spamming (mass email, mass newsgroup posting, etc.).
- Advertising on sites containing or promoting illegal activities.
- Failure to disclose the affiliate relationship for any promotion that qualifies as an endorsement under existing Federal Trade Commission guidelines and regulations, or any applicable state laws.
- Violation of intellectual property rights. BetterPic reserves the right to require license agreements from those who employ trademarks of BetterPic in order to protect our intellectual property rights.
- Offering rebates, coupons, or other forms of promised kick-backs from your affiliate commission as an incentive. Adding bonuses or bundling other products with BetterPic, however, is acceptable.
- Self-referrals, fraudulent transactions, suspected Affiliate fraud.

In addition to the foregoing, BetterPic reserves the right to terminate any Affiliate account at any time, for any violations of this Agreement or for no reason.

## 4. Affiliate Links
You may use graphic and text links both on your website and within your email messages. You may also advertise the BetterPic site in online and offline classified ads, magazines, and newspapers.

You may use the graphics and text provided by us, or you may create your own as long as they are deemed appropriate according to the conditions and not in violation as outlined in Condition 3.

## 5. Coupon and Deal Sites
BetterPic occasionally offers coupons to select affiliates. If you’re not pre-approved / assigned a branded coupon, then you’re not allowed to promote the coupon. Below are the terms that apply for any affiliate who is considering the promotion of our products in relation to a deal or coupon:

- Affiliates may not use misleading text on affiliate links, buttons, or images to imply that anything besides currently authorized deals to the specific affiliate.
- Affiliates may not bid on BetterPic Coupons, BetterPic Discounts, or other phrases implying coupons are available.
- Affiliates may not generate pop-ups, pop-unders, iframes, frames, or any other seen or unseen actions that set affiliate cookies unless the user has expressed a clear and explicit interest in activating a specific savings by clicking on a clearly marked link, button or image for that particular coupon or deal. Your link must send the visitor to the merchant site.
- Users must be able to see coupon/deal/savings information and details before an affiliate cookie is set (i.e. “click here to see coupons and open a window to the merchant site” is NOT allowed).
- Affiliate sites may not have “Click for (or to see) Deal/Coupon” or any variation when there are no coupons or deals available, and the click opens the merchant site or sets a cookie. Affiliates with such text on the merchant landing page will be removed from the program immediately.

## 6. Pay Per Click (PPC) Policy
PPC bidding is NOT allowed without prior written permission.

## 7. Liability
BetterPic will not be liable for indirect or accidental damages (loss of revenue, commissions) due to affiliate tracking failures, loss of database files, or any results of intents of harm to the Program and/or to our website(s).

We do not make any expressed or implied warranties with respect to the Program and/or the memberships or products sold by BetterPic. We make no claim that the operation of the Program and/or our website(s) will be error-free and we will not be liable for any interruptions or errors.

## 8. Term of the Agreement

The terms and conditions of this agreement may be modified by us at any time. If any modification to the terms and conditions of this Agreement are unacceptable to you, your only choice is to terminate your Affiliate account.
