## Introduction
Welcome to **BetterPic (“Company”, “we”, “our”, “us”)**! We are committed to providing a fair refund policy to our customers. This Refund Policy, governed by the previous Terms of Service, outlines the circumstances in which refunds can be made.

## Refund Eligibility
Refunds requested within 14 days of purchase are eligible for a full refund if the order process has not been completed and no AI model has been trained. If the order process has begun or an AI model has been trained but you have not downloaded any generated images, a 10% non-refundable withholding fee will be applied to your refund amount. If the user has downloaded any images generated by our trained AI model, you will not be eligible for a refund.

In case of service outages, delays or disruptions, we will strive to fulfill your order as soon as possible. However, if we cannot fulfill your order within a reasonable timeframe, you may be eligible for a refund.

If your refund request pertains to the quality of the results, please first ensure that you complied with the photo requirements that were outlined prior to initiating your order:
- Upload a total of 10 chest-up photos, 2 side-profile shots, and 3 half-body images.
- Vary the environment and your facial expressions across the photos.
- Steer clear of wearing glasses or hats, using excessive makeup, or appearing nude in the photos. Avoid repetitive angles and poses.
- Exclude photos where you are not looking at the camera, photos featuring multiple people, or those of poor quality. Avoid strange facial expressions and overly close shots.
- Failure to adhere to these guidelines may affect the outcome and eligibility for a refund.

## Refund Procedure
Customers eligible for a refund should contact BetterPic's customer support team to submit a refund request. You may need to provide certain information relevant to your Purchase including, without limitation, your full name, payment method and reason for refund. We highly recommend including screenshots to clearly illustrate any issues you've experienced.

All refund requests will be considered and responded to within a reasonable period of time. Where a refund is granted, it will be processed to the same payment method used during the initial transaction.

## Time Frame for Processing Refunds
If a refund is granted, the amount will be credited back to the original payment method within 7-10 business days.

## Appeal Process
In the event that your refund request is denied, you have the option to appeal the decision within 7 days by contacting our Customer Support Team for a re-evaluation.
