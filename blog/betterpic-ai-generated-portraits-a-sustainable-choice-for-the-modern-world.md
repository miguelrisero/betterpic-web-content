## The Environmental Impact of Traditional Photography

### Energy Consumption in Photo Studios

Traditional photography requires significant energy consumption. From lighting to equipment, photo studios utilize a substantial amount of electricity, contributing to a larger carbon footprint. The energy used in traditional studios often comes from non-renewable sources, further exacerbating environmental concerns.

### Waste Generated by Physical Prints

The production of physical prints leads to waste, including paper, ink, and chemicals. This waste not only affects the environment but also adds to the overall cost of traditional photography. The chemicals used in developing prints can be harmful, and the paper waste contributes to deforestation.

### Travel and Transportation Footprint

Traveling to and from photo studios requires transportation, adding to the overall environmental impact. The carbon emissions from vehicles contribute to pollution and climate change. This travel-related footprint is an often-overlooked aspect of traditional photography that adds to its environmental toll.
