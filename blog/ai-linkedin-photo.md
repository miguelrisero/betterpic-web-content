Imagine flipping through LinkedIn and stopping dead on a profile.

What hooked you?

Chances are, it was a striking profile photo.

But what if that photo wasn’t just a happy accident but a carefully crafted image powered by AI?

From now on, your LinkedIn image doesn’t just represent you; it actively works for you.

With the use of AI you can transform standard snapshots (selfies and casual pics) into professional, studio-quality headshots.

Imagine getting a pro shot without the hefty price tag or hours spent in a photographer's studio.



## 1. Understanding the Role of a LinkedIn Photo

Ever wondered why certain LinkedIn profiles stand out of the crowd?

Sure the reason behind that is manifold.

Yet a stellar profile picture boosts your visibility significantly.

Here’s something to think about: profiles sporting professional photos draw up to 21 times more views and 36 times more messages.

It’s not just about looking good.

It’s about leveraging your image to build a broader, more engaged professional network.

And the best part? You don’t need to step outside your door or spend a fortune to get there.



## 2. Basics of a Good LinkedIn Photo

![ai-linkedin-photo-blone-woman](/assets/reusable-media/batchs/mixed_ethnicity_and_gender/batch_1/06649-woman,_arab-35-blonde_hair--.jpg)

Creating a good-looking and eye-catching LinkedIn photo goes beyond just smiling at the camera.

It's about creating a visual narrative that aligns with your professional persona.

I know, that sounds boring, but basically: make sure you look the part.

Here’s how you can fine-tune each element for a good-looking, effective headshot:

**Lighting**: It's the most obvious part, yet many still get this wrong. You don't need to do much, just have good light on your face. A right light for example can turn your photo from ordinary to outstanding. Opt for soft, natural light to smooth skin tones and minimise harsh shadows.  You don't have a light? Not to worry. Sit near a window or use a soft light source for an even, flattering effect. Avoid harsh overhead lighting, which can create unappealing shadows under your eyes.

**Clothing**: Your clothes should mirror the professional standards of your industry. If you're in a formal sector like law or finance, a suit might be ideal. In more creative fields, something less formal but equally fitting could be more suitable. Stick to solid colours to maintain focus on your face; busy patterns can be distracting.

**Background**: Keep it clean and uncomplicated. A plain wall, an arranged bookshelf, or an outdoor setting with a soft-focus background can work well. Make sure the background complements rather than competes with your professional setup. In other words: make sure it doesn't steal the show and that you don't look out of place. Avoid busy or messy backgrounds that draw attention away from you.

**Pose and Expression**: Now this is something sooo many people get wrong. When I say aim for a natural pose with an approachable expression - you may get confused about what that means. But really, it just means pose as you would when a loved one you are waiting for is getting close to you. You know, a genuine smile and a generic pose. You can practise it in front of a mirror to find your best angle and a genuine smile. Direct eye contact with the camera can help establish a connection with the ones seeing your photo, which can make your profile more engaging.

**Technical Details**: I mean, I know this one is a 'no shit Sherlock' one as well, but make sure your photo is high-resolution. As much as this should be obvious, many still seem to think that the screenshot of a screenshot of a screenshot of a picture they took 5 years ago 'will do'. The ideal size is 400x400 pixels. A poorly resized photo can detract from your profile's professionalism.

But while that may sound like a lot, the good news is that** sophisticated AI tools like BetterPic take the hassle out of getting a perfect headshot by taking care of all these elements above. **

You can literally upload selfies and casual shots (where you are clearly visible and not doing any weird things with your face) and without the high costs associated with professional photo shoots it will transform it to 4k quality headshots.

## 3. Advancements in AI for Photography

![ai-linkedin-photo-male-corporate-suit](/assets/reusable-media/batchs/mixed_ethnicity_and_gender/batch_1/06908-man,_arab-35-black_hair-black_pinstripe_suit-corporate_building.jpg)

Although I think most of you will have some ideas on how AI in photography changes things, let's do a quick reminder on why it makes sense.

While AI definitely has been a somewhat overused term for the past few years (especially last year)  it’s certainly not just a fancy buzzword. It is quite clearly revolutionising many areas.

When it comes to photography, for example, they can democratise something that for long has been the luxury of few.

AI tools can analyse millions of images, learning what makes a photo stunning. This tech is not just improving how photos are edited but transforming the process from the ground up. It can ensure that every element, like lighting and background, is on point, and do it with the use of ok selfies and casual shots.

So even if you’re not a pro behind the lens, AI's got your back, making sure your professional headshots (like your LinkedIn photo, a resume/cv picture etc.) looks like it's shot by a top-tier photographer.

Of course, photographers are still great and will not be put aside by AI tools, but perhaps some areas of their expertise may be more readily available to gen. pop. without needing to acquire a new wardrobe and spend a hefty sum on a professional shoot.

## 6. Tips for Taking Photos with Your Smartphone


Getting professional quality shots:

Thanks to apps like [BetterPic](https://www.betterpic.io), today your smartphone is your best friend when it comes to shooting a LinkedIn-worthy photo.

First, maximise either natural light » shoot near a window or outdoors on an overcast day to avoid harsh shadows, or use equally distributed lighting on your face (like a ring light) with additional light for depth (like an LED light or something with dim light in the background).

Use the back camera for higher resolution and set a timer to avoid shakiness. Select portrait mode and make sure you set depth control for the right focus. Keep the phone steady, possibly with a makeshift tripod, to ensure the focus is sharp.

Finish your headshots with AI: Post-shoot, use AI technology with apps like BetterPic to refine your photos. These apps can adjust lighting, enhance colours, and even suggest optimal cropping.

This turns a good photo into a great one by analysing thousands of professional shots and applying the winning formulas to your pictures.

### AI Suggestions for Attire

The point is that you don’t need to get a new wardrobe to get the right shot.
